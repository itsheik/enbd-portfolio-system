   `Bidders are strongly encouraged to read the Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale which describe the terms governing the purchase of all property sold at auction.`,
   `1. Definitions. As used in these Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale, the following words have the meaning set forth below:Bidder is any person participating, making or attempting to make a bid at an Auction Sale.Buyer is the person who makes the highest bid accepted by the Auctioneer, including the principal of any Bidder acting as an agent.Buyer’s Expense means all costs or expenses payable by the Buyer in addition to the Purchase Price, in connection with the sale, such as applicable storage costs.Buyer’s Premium is the commission payable by the Buyer to the Auctioneer in the amount of twenty-three percent (23%) of the Hammer Price and a minimum Buyer's Premium of $10.00Hammer Price is the bid accepted by the Auctioneer by the fall of the hammer, or in the case of a post auction sale, the agreed upon sales price.Purchase Price is the sum of the Hammer Price, Buyer‘s Premium and all applicable taxes.Reserve is the confidential minimum Hammer Price at which the Seller has agreed to sell a lot. Seller is the person, including agents, personal representatives and executors, offering a lot or lots for sale`,
   `2. Auction Basics. This is a public wine auction sale (the "Auction Sale") conducted by SPECTRUM WINE AUCTIONS, LLC, a California limited liability company, a bonded auctioneer (referred to as "Auctioneer" or "ENBD Portfolio Auctions”). Lot(s) may carry a Reserve. Prior to bidding, all participants must read the Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale, which describe the terms governing the purchase of wine sold at the Auction Sale. By participating in the auction, a Bidder agrees to be bound by the Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale printed in the auction catalogue, posted on the Auctioneer’s website or posted at the Auction Sale. As auctioneer, ENBD Portfolio Auctions acts only as agent for the Seller. The sale contract for the lot(s) purchased at the Auction Sale is made directly between the Buyer and Seller. In those instances when the Auctioneer is the owner of a lot, it will also be the Seller.Sellers may bid and purchase lot(s) in the Auction Sale consigned by other Sellers.  ENBD Portfolio Auctions reserves the right to include its own wine, as well as wine from affiliated or related companies, principals, officers or employees, in any Auction Sale. ENBD Portfolio Auctions may have direct or indirect interests in any of the lots in the Auction Sale and may collect commissions other than the Buyer’s Premium. THE TWO PRECEEDING SENTENCES SHALL BE DEEMED A PART OF THE DESCRIPTION OF ALL LOTS CONTAINED IN THE AUCTION CATALOGUE.`,
   `ENBD Portfolio Auctions may bid for its own account at any Auction Sale without being required to pay a Buyer's Commission, or other charges that other Buyers may be required to pay.`,
   `3 Descriptions. To the Auctioneer’s knowledge, per information provided by Sellers, all wines offered for sale have been properly stored and transported prior to arrival at our temperature- and humidity-controlled storage facility. Each bottle has been described as accurately as possible. However, Buyers of older and more fragile wines or spirits, and/or those specifically packed in fragile, decorative containers, should be aware of and make proper allowances for natural variations of ullage and general conditions and for alterations that could arise in shipment. All Bidders are encouraged to inspect and investigate lots they are interested in prior to purchase. Bidders acknowledge that ENBD Portfolio Auctions is not representing or warranting that, and has no responsibility or liability for, the accuracy of the catalogue descriptions, including without limitation, vintage, provenance, authenticity, quality and condition. Any and all statements relating to the wine in the catalogue, or contained in advertisements or promotional materials, are merely statements of opinion and should not be construed as, nor do they constitute representations or warranties of fact or the assumption of any liability on the part of ENBD Portfolio Auctions or the Seller.`,
   `4. Bidder Registration Required. All persons seeking to bid must have a catalogue and register to bid at the Auction Sale by completing a registration card or bid sheet. Please be prepared to provide bank references, identification and a major credit card. Major credit cards and/or driver’s licenses will be required as identification. Bidders must be at least 21 years old and may be required to show proof of age. By submitting a bid, the Bidder acknowledges that Bidder has read the Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale, the descriptions for the lot(s) on which they have bid, and that they agree to adhere to these Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale. All Bidders are personally liable for their bids, whether or not acting as an agent. This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in California. The Bidder acknowledges that the invoice describing a lot by number incorporates the catalogue and Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale.`,
   `5. The Bidding Process. The Auctioneer may open or accept the bidding on any lot by placing a bid on behalf of the Seller, a mail, telephone, internet or telefax Bidder; or any other Bidder in the Auction Sale. The Auctioneer may accept or decline any bid, challenge any bid or set bidding increments, as the Auctioneer in its sole discretion shall determine. All wine shall be sold in separate lots to the highest Bidder as determined by the Auctioneer. Bids must be for an entire lot and each lot constitutes a separate sale. No lot will be broken up unless otherwise permitted by the Auctioneer. Lots will be sold in their numbered sequence unless Auctioneer directs otherwise. Auctioneer shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to adjudicate all bidding disputes and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to rescind the acceptance of any bid and place the lot(s) for Auction Sale again. Auctioneer's decision on all bidding disputes shall be binding and final. For the mail and internet Bidder's protection, no "unlimited" or "buy" bids will be accepted. When identical bids are received for a lot, preference is given to the first bid received as determined by the Auctioneer. An absentee bid will take precedence over an identical floor bid; a Floor Bidder and Telephone Bidder must bid higher than the highest absentee bid to be awarded any lot. Auctioneer reserves the right to refuse any bid, to reduce any absentee bid received, to open the bidding of a lot at any level deemed appropriate by the Auctioneer and to determine the prevailing bid, in its sole discretion.`,
   `THIS IS NOT AN APPROVAL SALE. Bidders who physically attend the Auction Sale, either personally or through an agent ("Floor Bidders") should carefully examine all lots which they are interested in purchasing. Bidders who bid by telephone, either personally or through an agent, receive a similar benefit as Floor Bidders in being able to actively participate in the live Auction Sale ("Telephone Bidders"). Therefore, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms and Conditions of Auction Sale, WINE LISTED IN THIS CATALOGUE MAY NOT BE RETURNED FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER BY ANY BIDDER. If it is determined in a review by Auctioneer that there is a material error in the catalogue description of a lot, the lot may be returned if written notice is received by Auctioneer within seventy-two (72) hours of Buyer’s receipt of the lot(s). Thereafter, the lot(s) must be received by Auctioneer no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after such written notice, in the same condition the lot(s) were delivered to the Bidder, in their original, wooden cases (if applicable). Late return constitutes just cause for revocation of all return privileges. All prospective Bidders who have the opportunity to examine the lot(s) prior to the Auction Sale personally assume all responsibility for any damage that Bidder causes in connection with examining the lot(s). Auctioneer shall have sole discretion in determining the value of the damage caused, which shall be promptly paid by the prospective Bidder. AUCTIONEER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS IN BIDDING. A Bidder should make certain to bid on the correct lot and that the bid is the bid intended. Once the hammer has fallen and the Auctioneer has announced the winning Bidder, the Bidder is unconditionally bound to pay for the lot, even if the Bidder has made a mistake. Auctioneer reserves the right to withdraw any lot at any time, even after the hammer has fallen, until the Bidder has taken physical possession of the lot. No Bidder shall have a right to claim any consequential damages if a lot is withdrawn, even after the Auction Sale. `,
   `6. Passage of Title and Other Conditions of Sale. Subject to fulfillment of all of the conditions set forth herein, on the fall of the Auctioneer’s hammer, physical or electronic, title to the offered lot will pass directly and immediately to the highest Bidder within the jurisdiction of and according to the laws of the State of California and the Uniform Commercial Code, acknowledged and accepted by the Auctioneer, and thereupon, such Bidder: (a) assumes full risk and responsibility for the purchased lot, and (b) shall pay the Purchase Price and all Buyer Expenses and Fees in full, in accordance with the conditions set forth herein. Payment will not be deemed to have been made in full until Auctioneer has collected good funds. In the event the Buyer fails to pay any or all of the total Purchase Price for any lot and Auctioneer nonetheless elects to pay the Seller any portion of the sale proceeds, the Buyer acknowledges that Auctioneer shall have all of the rights of the Seller to pursue the Buyer for any amounts paid to the Seller, whether at law, in equity, or under these Conditions of Sale. Auction lots located and stored within the State of California sell within, and title passes directly to the Buyer within, the State of California. Upon passage of title to the Buyer, ENBD Portfolio agrees to store Buyer's property on Buyer's behalf within the State of California. Buyer is free to contract with a third party packer/shipper at Buyer’s sole risk, expense, and responsibility to ship Buyer’s property to a jurisdiction as well as to an appropriate receiving address where it is both legal and permissible for such third party packer/shipper to deliver such property; alternatively, Buyer is free to enter into a a long-term storage contract within California. It is Buyer’s sole responsibility to pay all necessary sales or use taxes in any chosen, final jurisdiction, if, when, or where applicable.`,
   `7. Prices, Payment and Delivery. A Buyer's Commission of twenty-three percent (23%) of the Hammer Price on each individual lot will be added to all purchases (with the exception of re-acquisitions by Sellers) and a minimum Buyer's Premium of $10.00. Payment is due immediately upon receipt of notification. Payment is delinquent and in default if not made in good funds in full within fourteen (14) days after the Auction Sale, without exception. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, auction sales are strictly cash in U.S. funds payable through a bank in the United States. On any cash transaction or series of transactions exceeding $10,000, Treasury Form 8300 will be filed. Contact ENBD Portfolio Auctions for wiring instructions before sending a wire. Lots must be paid for prior delivery. ENBD Portfolio Auctions reserves the right to decline to release lots for which good funds have not yet been received. On any accounts past due, ENBD Portfolio Auctions reserves the right to extend credit and impose periodic charges. Bidder agrees to pay reasonable attorney's fees and cost incurred to collect on such past due accounts. Payment by Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover may be accepted only for internet bidders whose total purchases for the Auction Sale do not exceed $10,000. Bids will not be accepted from those persons under twenty-one (21) years of age. Bidders personally and unconditionally guarantee payment of the Purchase Price for all purchased lots and any amounts that are or become owed to ENBD Portfolio Auctions. If a corporation is the Bidder, the corporate representative present at the sale shall provide ENBD Portfolio Auctions at the time of registration with a statement signed by each principal, director and officer that they each personally and unconditionally guarantee any and all current or future obligations owed to ENBD Portfolio Auctions or such other statement as may be acceptable to ENBD Portfolio Auctions, in its sole discretion. Bidders who have not established credit with ENBD Portfolio Auctions must furnish satisfactory credit references or deposit at least twenty-five percent (25%) of their total bids for that Auction Sale session(s) or such other amounts as ENBD Portfolio Auctions may, in its sole and absolute discretion, require before such bids will be accepted. Deposits submitted will be applied to purchases. Any remaining deposits will be promptly refunded, upon clearance of funds.  ENBD Portfolio Auctions will charge a credit card held on file automatically if a balance is open past the due date.  ENBD Portfolio Auctions reserves the right to hold paid orders if any past due amounts are pending.`,
   `ectrum Wine Auctions will not assume responsibility for the shipping and packaging of purchased lots. It is the Bidder's responsibility to arrange for pick up, delivery, or paid storage of purchased lots within fourteen (14) days of the Auction Sale. All purchased lots are at Buyer’s risk, including the responsibility to insure, at the earlier of pick up or fourteen (14) days after the Auction Sale. All packing, handling, and shipping is at the Buyer’s risk. ENBD Portfolio Auctions will not be liable for any acts, omissions, or oversights of third party packers or shippers.

   `Licensees who intend to bid should provide Auctioneer well in advance of the Auction Sale a photocopy of the license issued by their state’s liquor authority. Licensees within the state of California should also provide a resale certificate. Lots purchased by licensees will be routed through a properly licensed California wholesaler, who will charge the applicable taxes and fees.`,
   `Bidders/Buyers are cautioned that many states impose restrictions on the quantity of alcoholic beverages which may be purchased and brought into its jurisdiction from another state. In some instances, special permits, licenses, fees, or taxes may be required for the Buyer or the Buyer's chosen shipper. Buyer assumes all responsibility for acquiring any necessary permits or licenses as well as for paying all necessary fees and taxes in Buyer's chosen delivery jurisdiction.Bidders/Buyers are responsible for all applicable shipping costs, fees, or tariffs associated with their order.  Import fees or tariffs may apply for all wine purchased outside of the United States and imported for US-based buyers.  In addition to freight costs, import fees from Hong Kong to the US begin at $30 per lot and are shipped via temperature controlled ocean freight unless otherwise requested.  Any additional tariffs imposed upon import are the sole responsibility of the Buyer.`,
   `International Buyers are solely responsible for arranging lawful export of purchased spirits and are solely responsible for all customs, duties, taxes, tariffs, or other charges that may arise therefrom.ENBD Portfolio does not ship via FedEx on Fridays.  All other carriers are available for Friday shipments.Please note: We are no longer using ‘Golden State Overnight’ (aka GSO, aka GLS) as a primary or default shipping carrier in any state.  Beginning March 2021, UPS will become the default carrier chosen for you in those states to which ENBD Portfolio can ship directly (CA, DC, NM, ID, and AK).  ENBD Portfolio can still ship your wine orders via GSO/GLS upon request. Please note, however, that GSO/GLS is no longer covered under any of our insurance options.  If there is any loss, damage, or other liability relating to your chosen GSO/GLS shipment, we will be unable to file any type of claim or provide any form of reimbursement.  Shipping via GSO/GLS is solely at your risk.Auction Lots as well as Auction Orders may only be shipped in their entirety.`,

Further, if such purchased lot is not picked up within six (6) months of the date of the Auction Sale, Buyer authorizes ENBD Portfolio Auctions to arrange for a resale of the lot, either by auction or private sale, with reserves established at the Auctioneers discretion. All proceeds, less cost of sale and any unpaid applicable Buyer’s Expenses, will be remitted to the Buyer.`,

On any tax not paid by Bidder which should have been paid, even if not collected by ENBD Portfolio Auctions by mistake, error, negligence or gross negligence, Bidder agrees to promptly pay the same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be assessed. 8. Financial Responsibility. In the event a Buyer fails to make payment when due, in addition to other remedies available to Auctioneer and the Seller by law, including without limitation, the right to hold the Buyer liable for the total Purchase Price, ENBD Portfolio Auctions reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to rescind the sale or to resell the lot(s) in a commercially reasonable manner, which may include a public or private sale.

Buyer grants to ENBD Portfolio Auctions or its assignees the right to offset any sums due, or found to be due to ENBD Portfolio Auctions or its affiliates, and to make such offset from any past, current, or future consignment, or purchases that are in the possession or control of ENBD Portfolio Auctions or its affiliates; or from any sums due to Buyer from ENBD Portfolio Auctions or its affiliates. In addition, a defaulting Buyer will be deemed to have granted and assigned to ENBD Portfolio Auctions and its affiliated companies, a continuing security interest of first priority in any property or money of or owing to such Buyer in our possession or in the possession of any of its affiliated companies, and ENBD Portfolio Auctions may retain and apply such property or money as collateral security for the obligations due to us or to any of its affiliates.
